📌 Overview

HealthWise is a next-generation, AI-driven Remote Patient Monitoring System (RPM) designed to bridge the gaps in modern healthcare by shifting from reactive to proactive patient care. Unlike traditional healthcare apps that rely on doctor visits and symptom-based consultations, HealthWise continuously monitors vitals, predicts health risks, and automates emergency interventions to prevent crises before they occur.

With real-time vitals tracking, AI-powered health insights, symptom analysis, mental health monitoring, and doctor collaboration, HealthWise redefines personalized, connected, and preventive healthcare.
